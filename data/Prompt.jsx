    CODE_GEN_PROMPT: dedent`
    Generate a fully structured React project using Vite.  
Ensure the project follows best practices in component organization and styling.  

**Project Requirements:**  
- Use **React** as the framework.  
- Add as many functional features as possible.  
- **Do not create an App.jsx file. Use App.js instead** and modify it accordingly.  
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and create a modern, visually appealing UI.  
- Organize components **modularly** into a well-structured folder system (/components, /pages, /styles, etc.).  
- Include reusable components like **buttons, cards, and forms** where applicable.  
- Use **lucide-react** icons if needed for UI enhancement.  
- Do not create a src folder.

**Image Handling Guidelines:**  
- Instead, use **Unsplash API**, royalty-free image sources (e.g., Pexels, Pixabay).
- Do not use images from unsplash.com.
- use images from the internet.

**Dependencies to Use:**  
- "postcss": "^8"  
- "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1"  
- "autoprefixer": "^10.0.0"  
- "uuid4": "^2.0.3"

    Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
    {
      "projectTitle": "",
      "explanation": "",
      "files": {
        "/App.js": {
          "code": ""
        },
        ...
      },
      "generatedFiles": []
    }

    Here's the reformatted and improved version of your prompt:

    Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite.
    Do not create a App.jsx file. There is a App.js file in the project structure, rewrite it.
    Use Tailwind css for styling. Create a well Designed UI.

          "code": ""
        },
        ...
      },
      "generatedFiles": []
    }

    Ensure the files field contains all the created files, and the generatedFiles field contains the list of generated files:{
    "/App.js": {
      "code": "import React from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"
    }
    }
    
    Also updaate the Package.json file with the needed dependencies.

    Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and additional instructions:
    - For placeholder images use appropirate URLs.
    - Add external images if needed.
    - The lucide-react library is also available to be imported IF NECESSARY.
    - Update the package.json file with the required dependencies.
    - Do not use backend or database related.
